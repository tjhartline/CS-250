README
•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? 
I ensure I have a clear understanding of what the customer is communicating or trying to communicate. I then give them examples and samples of what I interpreted to ensure we are on the same page with their expectations and mine.
•	How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories are extremely helpful for understanding what it is the customer is needing. A good example is the work done on the travel agency project. We were first given feedback from consumers of the type of features they would like. Upon breaking their requests apart, it was easy to see that the main components of this application would consist of the ability to filter. While this is not the wording the clients used, I was able to interpret it into that with the help of creating a user story for each related item.
•	How do I approach developing programs? 
1st. Ensure the user story is complete and accurate.
2nd. Create pseudocode/flowchart that breaks down the ideas in mind to be implemented during development.
3rd. Always ask questions when not certain of something. Sometimes this can come through communication within your team, and others it could require reaching out to stakeholders, consumers, or the client.
4th. When able, use test driven development process, and make certain to use industry standard best practices, and to remain on brand with the company who hired you to do the project.
•	What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The main one is collaboration and teamwork. I love the creativity and overall positive work environment that comes from using the agile method, especially as it relates to collaborating with your team, and the removal of so many bureaucratic practices that hinder efficiency of time.
•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member, you offer feedback in a constructive way, are always willing to help someone upskill if they are willing and wanting to learn, you lend a hand wherever you are needed, regardless of whether you enjoy the task at hand, and you always continue learning. By learning more and continuing to grow within your role, you are able to better serve your company, your team, your end users, and yourself.
